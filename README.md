RubyEDS
=======


Forked from Sam Popowich. Switched to use httpclient, and a more general search method that allows more sophisticated queries.

Ruby wrapper for the EDS API.

This module is based on Nitin Arora's Python binding for the EDS API.
It provides more or less the same interface, allowing users to:
 - authenticate with a username and password
 - open and close a session
 - perform a search (specifying JSON or XML return type)
 - pretty print the JSON or XML results

There are, however a few changes:
 - I removed the authenticate_with_file method, as you can use a config to provide credentials anyway (see examples)
  - I allowed for both XML and JSON return types (with the default being XML).

As with Nitin's PyEDS, there are a few things left to do:
 - add more options to basicSearch() like "facets", "search mode", "fulltext", "thesaurus", etc.
 - consider adding an authenticateIP() function that uses the IP authentication method.
 - deal with expired tokens, etc.
 - change argument lists to argument hashes to conform to ruby style.
 - use something like the fakeweb gem to avoid hitting the API during tests.

Eventually, the plan will be for this to integrate directly into the Blacklight/EDS project.

Not checked into this repository is a util.conf file that contains our EDS authentication credentials.
